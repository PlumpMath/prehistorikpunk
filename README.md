Fight robotic dinosaurs and dino bots in a steampunk world where you play as a prehistorik steampunk man!

It's A 2D platform game where you go from right to left! 

In Prehistoric Punk you begin at the end of the game and as you progress you come close to the beginning of the game, WHAT?!? yes, that's true :)
